# Secret-GPT

This project allows users to interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT API in a way that keeps usage hidden, 
even from someone watching over your shoulder. 
It disguises the interaction by embedding API requests within regular-looking workflows, 
making it appear as though you're performing unrelated tasks.
